# Shopify-search
The Shopify Search Engine is a lightweight program that allows you to search for products within a Shopify store. The program is written in Python and uses the Python Requests library and Regex to scrape the Shopify store's database and return relevant search results.

# Inspiration
Picture the experience of searching on Google, Youtube or Facebook - inputting a few words and instantly accessing an endless stream of relevant content, including those you never knew you needed. That same experience imspired me to create a Shopify search engine. As a developer, I recognized the immense value of a search engine tailored for e-commerce business. And with the little resources I had, I thought that would be cool to build one myself. It's lightweight and not as sophisticated as the companies like Google and Youtube have theirs built but it delivers fast, reliable and accurate search results.

# Installation
To use the Shopify Search Engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/OsimFavour/Shopify-search`.
2. Install the necessary Python packages (requests, re).
3. Run the program by running `python main.py`.


# Usage
To use the Shopify Search Engine, simply enter the name of the shopify store first and then input the product you're looking for and hit enter. The program will then scrape the Shopify store's database and return a list of relevant search results.

# Limitations
Please note that the Shopify Search Engine can only search for products that are listed on the Shopify store's database. Additionally, the program is highly sensitive to spelling errors.
