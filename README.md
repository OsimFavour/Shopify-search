# Shopify-search


# Description

I got inspired to build this shopify search engine when I saw how google search engine was, and also other search algorithms like Youtube's and Facebook's,
it was so cool inputing words and getting data that ranges from thousands to millions of search words that you'd never even think of but you actually needed. I thought that would be cool to build seeing that every website will always needs one

This is a lightweight search engine for only shopify stores, this algorithm inputs in a shopify store and you can search for any product that you want to search for or you'd want to track.

# Inspiration

Picture the experience of searching on Google, Youtube or Facebook - inputting a few words and instantly accessing an endless stream of relevant content, including those you never knew you needed. That same experience imspired me to create a Shopify search engine. As a developer, I recognized the immense value of a search engine tailored for e-commerce business. And with the little resources I had, I thought that would be cool to build one myself. It's lightweight and not as sophisticated as the companies like Google and Youtube have theirs built but it delivers fast, reliable and accurate search results.
