# Shopify-search


# Description

I got inspired to build this shopify search engine when I saw how google search engine was, and also other search algorithms like Youtube's and Facebook's,
it was so cool inputing words and getting data that ranges from thousands to millions of search words that you'd never even think of but you actually needed. I thought that would be cool to build seeing that every website will always needs one

This is a lightweight search engine for only shopify stores, this algorithm inputs in a shopify store and you can search for any product that you want to search for or you'd want to track.
